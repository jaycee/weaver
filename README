WEAVER

Weaver is a simple system to help create the necessary bits and pieces for a particular type of fabric based deployment.

ABOUT

Weaver was created to 1) scratch an itch 2) help my deploys. As such it is curretnly highly geared towards my needs, but will hopefully become more useful over time.

As a result of its being geared directly towards my usage, it makes a couple of assumptions:

1) You will deploy along the same directory structure on every server.
2) You will have set up every server with the same username for administration
3) You will be using lighttpd as a proxy to handle static media and pass off to apache for django
4) You will be using mod_wsgi
5) You have three servers: one for internal usage, one for staging, and one for external production usage
6) You will have apache and lighttpd both setup with user/group of www-data

REQUIREMENTS

Python (built and tested with python 2.5)
Jinja2
Fabric 0.1.1 (You don't actually need this to run weaver, but weaver builds a fabfile for use with it, so weaver is pretty useless without it).
